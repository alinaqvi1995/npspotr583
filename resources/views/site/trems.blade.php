                                        <p>
                                            Use of Bridgeway Logistics LLC's site, services, or any of its features by you is a full acceptance of these Terms & Conditions. 
                                            This also applies to all phone orders, emails, or our online booking system. 
                                            If you don't want to accept the terms, then our services cannot be used by you.

                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="title">2) Service Agreement & Pickup/Delivery Schedule</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Bridgeway Logistics LLC is a bonded and licensed auto transport broker. 
                                            Our function is to arrange and coordinate the safe transport of your vehicle with one of our approved carriers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>We use only thoroughly screened, insured, and seasoned carriers.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Pickup and delivery dates offered when booking are estimates and cannot be guaranteed. 
                                            Inclement weather, traffic, mechanical breakdowns, or scheduling conflicts could lead to delays.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Once a carrier is assigned to your order, Bridgeway Logistics has completed its role as a broker. 
                                            Any further responsibilities lie with the assigned carrier.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We make every effort to inform customers in the event of a delay, 
                                            but Bridgeway Logistics LLC does not take responsibility for failing to meet deadlines.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="title">3) Booking Form & Future Orders</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Any new customer has to fill out and sign a Booking Form prior to their first shipment. 
                                            This is the point of starting your agreement with Bridgeway Logistics LLC.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>This document will be kept on file for subsequent shipments. For repeat clients, we will make bookings without asking for a new form every time.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            By requesting our services again, you acknowledge that all subsequent orders shall automatically be subject to the same Terms & Conditions, unless revised.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This procedure enables us to save time for repeat clients without compromising on the same protections to each order.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="title">4) Carrier/Transporter's Bill of Lading</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Once a carrier is appointed to transport your vehicle, the Bill of Lading produced by the carrier is the governing document.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Bill of Lading documents your vehicle's condition prior to and after transportation.</p>
                                        <p>The terms of the Bill of Lading take precedence over all other arrangements and are applied to damage claims.</p>
                                        <p>Customers should thoroughly read the Bill of Lading prior to signing.</p>

                                        <h3 class="title">5) Third-Party Links</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Our site may contain links to other websites. 
                                            Bridgeway Logistics LLC has no authority over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of those third-party websites. 
                                            Customers should read those policies prior to submitting any personal or financial information.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="title">6) Insurance & Claims</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Each carrier appointed by Bridgeway Logistics LLC carries insurance coverage as mandated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>This coverage insures your vehicle in transit, but only for damages resulting from the negligence of the carrier.</p>
                                        <p>In case of damage, claims should be made directly against the carrier. Bridgeway Logistics LLC does not handle or accept damage claims on behalf of customers.</p>
                                        <p>Customers are advised to read the carrier's insurance documents prior to pickup and ask for a copy if necessary.</p>

                                        <h3 class="title">7) Exclusions from Liability</h3>
                                        <p>Damages caused by the following will not be the responsibility of carriers:</p>
                                        <ul class="list-gap">
                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Pre-existing mechanical defects (engine, transmission, electrical system, clutch, airbags, etc.)</li>
                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Normal wear and tear (exhaust system, mufflers, convertible tops, tires, etc.)</li>

                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Damage due to aftermarket accessories, loose parts, or spoilers not removed prior to shipping</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3 class="title">8) Customer Responsibilities (Vehicle Preparation)</h3>
                                        <p>Prior to pickup, the customer is liable for ensuring proper preparation of the vehicle:</p>
                                        <ul class="list-gap">
                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Disarm or remove alarms.</li>
                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Take off loose accessories, spoilers, racks, or antennas that may come loose in transport.</li>
                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Have the vehicle ready for operation unless rented as a non-running vehicle.</li>
                                            <li><i class="fa-light fa-check"></i> Take out all personal items. Carriers and Bridgeway Logistics LLC disclaim any liability for lost or stolen property.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            Incorrect preparation of the vehicle could mean delays, extra fees, or damages for which the customer will be held accountable.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="title">9) Rental Car Policy</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Bridgeway Logistics LLC does not pay back rental car charges or offer rental cars in the case of transport delays, damages, or accidents. 
                                            Customers are advised to prepare ahead of time in case of unforeseen events.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            In case a carrier is sent and your car is not ready for pickup, a reposting fee of $100 will be levied to reschedule with another carrier. 
                                            This includes administrative and scheduling charges.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="title">11) Pickup & Delivery Agent</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            If the customer is not available for pickup or delivery, they need to designate an agent to receive on their behalf.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Agents are required to be 18 years or older.</p>
                                        <p>The carrier will give 3â€“24 hours' notice of pickup or delivery.</p>
                                        <p>If the delivery address cannot be reached by truck, customers or agents are to meet the driver at an off-site safe location.</p>

                                        </p>
                                        <p>Should the customer not make payment, the car can be warehoused at a local facility at the customer's cost.</p>
                                        <p>Should the carrier not be able to access your delivery location, you should meet at the nearest location accessible to the carrier.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            If the vehicle is not operable at pickup, or gets non-operable during transportation, there will be an extra $150 charge at delivery.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>New damages must be indicated on the delivery Bill of Lading at delivery.</p>

                                        </p>
